Project for Intro to javascript

Attempting to create a web app that allows users to add their suggestions for a shared trip. Trying to keep it simple, where a person can access the site and start their list of things they want to do. This would pop up different windows containing their lists. Ideally, you could click items from each person's list that would populate a more complete trip list.
