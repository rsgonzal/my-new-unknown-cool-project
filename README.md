# my-new-unknown-cool-project
Project for Intro to javascript

Attempting to create a web app that allows users to add their suggestions for a shared trip. Trying to keep it simple, where a person can access the site and and add list items of things they want to do. This would populate a shared list. Will try to implement an up-voting and down-voting system as a way for users to add their opinions on current items or items they were interested in adding before. Higher voted items will show up on top.
